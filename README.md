# Bloodborne for Windows

**Bloodborne running natively on Windows 10 and 11, by [Supermedo](https://github.com/Supermedo) Mohammed Albarghouthi.**

The original PlayStation 4 game runs directly on your PC: its own x86-64 code runs natively,
and the graphics are translated to Vulkan. No emulator window, no setup scripts: unpack the zip,
start `Bloodborne.exe`, pick your game folder and press **PLAY**.

> **No game files are included.** You need your own decrypted dump of Bloodborne
> (CUSA03173). Version 1.09 is needed for the community patches (60/90/unlocked FPS,
> resolution, effects); other versions run at 30 FPS.
> This project is not affiliated with Sony Interactive Entertainment or FromSoftware.

## Features

- **Launcher with every setting in one window**, in 13 languages: English, Arabic, Russian,
  Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Polish, Turkish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean.
- **Updates from the launcher:** when a new version is out it tells you, and **Update**
  installs it. Your saves, settings and mods are kept.
- **NVIDIA DLSS** on GeForce RTX cards (RTX 20 series and newer).
- **AMD FSR 3.1 and FSR 4** upscaling, plus native-resolution TAA.
- **Unlocked frame rate** with a frame cap (up to 120 by default), or 30/60/90 FPS.
- **Output resolutions** from 720p to 4K, presets from Native AA to Ultra Performance.
- **Cheats page:** never die, stealth, silent footsteps, Rally that never fades, enemy control,
  and gameplay tweaks (camera distance, no camera auto-rotation, easier running, ragdoll
  physics).
- **Game effects** on and off: chromatic aberration, depth of field, motion blur, SSAO, the
  game's own AA, dynamic light shadows, screen-space reflections, model detail.
- **Mods and third-party patches**, loaded without changing your game files.
- **`Play Bloodborne.exe`** starts the game straight away with your saved settings (good for a
  desktop shortcut or Steam).
- **Controller and keyboard**, an in-game settings menu (Insert or L3+R3), name entry on
  screen, a desktop shortcut, and a button to clear the shader cache.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 (1903 or later) or Windows 11, 64-bit
- A graphics card with Vulkan 1.3 and a current driver
- About 6 GB of free memory (RAM + page file), 10 GB for 1440p or 4K output
- DLSS: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20 series or newer

Nothing else to install: everything the game needs is in the zip.

## How to play

1. Download the zip from [Releases](https://github.com/Supermedo/bloodborne_pc/releases/latest)
   and unpack it anywhere.
2. Start `Bloodborne.exe`.
3. On **Game & effects**, choose your game folder (the one with `eboot.bin`).
4. Press **PLAY**.

In the game, **Insert** (or **L3+R3** on a controller) opens the settings menu.
Keyboard: WASD move, arrows camera, Space Cross, Left Shift Circle, E Square, Q Triangle,
1/3 L1/R1, R/F L2/R2, Z/C L3/R3, I/K/J/L d-pad, Enter Options, Tab touchpad.

## Known issues

> **Experimental NVIDIA/Windows test builds (`test/vram-gc`):** A RTX 5070
> session on 2026-10-08 ended in a full-system GPU timeout (`LiveKernelEvent 0x141`,
> Vulkan `Device lost during submit`). **Further gameplay testing on the affected
> machine is paused** until the problem is investigated. This does not by itself
> establish hardware damage, overheating, or a proven GC bug.
> See the [Windows/NVIDIA incident register](docs/WINDOWS_NVIDIA_INCIDENTS_2026-10.md)
> for the timeline, WinDbg findings, previous driver crashes, and the fixed GPU
> monitor script issue.

- The character preview on the character creation screen stays empty. The character is
  created correctly and looks right in the game.
- Some AMD graphics cards still crash when the game world loads; fixes are in progress.
- Above about 120 FPS the game's movement slows down (a limit of the game itself): keep the
  frame cap at 120 or lower.

## Problems and feedback

Ask on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/yTMG8c4Bqm), or open an [issue](https://github.com/Supermedo/bloodborne_pc/issues) and attach
`user\last_run.log` from the game folder, with your graphics card and what happened.
If the game shows only a black screen, try **Advanced → Clear shader cache** first.

## Building from source

See [packaging/windows/README.md](packaging/windows/README.md): MSYS2 CLANG64, `bash build.sh`,
then `bash packaging/windows/package.sh`. DLSS is built separately with
`packaging/windows/build_dlss.sh`.
